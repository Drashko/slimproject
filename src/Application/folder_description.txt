Application layer/folder - this layer includes:

• Application services/command handlers, and command DTOs
• View model repository interfaces, and view model DTOs
• Event subscribers that listen to domain events and perform secondary
tasks
• Interfaces for infrastructure services

• What actors can do with your application and what data an actor has to
provide for each task (represented by the application services and their
method parameters, which could be command DTOs).
• What an actor can learn from your application (represented by the view
model repository interfaces and the view model objects).
• How different use cases are connected to each other (represented by
the event subscribers).
• On which things in the outside world your use cases depend (represented by the interfaces for infrastructure services).
